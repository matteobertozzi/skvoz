The collector service is a simple TCP/Unix server that reads key-timestamped
lines sended by the client.

The line format is "key, timestamp, value" where timestamp is a msec int.
The client can send "key - value" to use the server time.

Where is the data stored?
-------------------------
By default each key is stored in a log file (sort is not guaranteed)
